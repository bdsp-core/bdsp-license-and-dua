## Terms of use
All Brain Data Science Platform (BDSP) data here are released openly and publicly for the benefit of the wider biomedical research community. You can freely download and search the data, and we encourage the use and publication of results generated from these data. There are no restrictions or embargoes on the publication of results derived from BDSP data. All users of BDSP data agree to not attempt to reidentify participants.

This data set has been subjected to extensive quality control, but the data is large and complex, so errors no doubt remain. If you spot any results that seem impossible, email us to let us know, and we'll do our best to address it.

The data released by BDSP are available free of restrictions under the Creative Commons Zero Public Domain Dedication. This means that you can use it for any purpose without legally having to give attribution. However, we request that you actively acknowledge and give attribution to the BDSP project, and link back to the relevant page, wherever possible. Attribution supports future efforts to release other data. It also reduces the amount of "orphaned data", helping retain links to authoritative sources.

Screenshots of the website may also be used without restriction. As with any use of BDSP data, we request that you actively acknowledge and give attribution to the BDSP project, and link back to the relevant page, wherever possible.

## Citation in publications
We request that any use of data obtained from the BDSP browser cite the BDSP flagship paper and any online resources that include the data set provide a link to the browser. 

There is no need to include us as authors on your manuscript, unless we contributed specific advice or analysis for your work.

## BDSP Ethics Policy
Data included in the BDSP database has met our ethical requirements including the Principal Investigator (PI) of all shared datasets signing our data use agreement (DUA), and careful review of each studyâ€™s consent to ensure data is appropriately consented for sharing.

## BDSP Data Preservation Policy
While we hope BDSP exists for decades to come, we recognize the importance of having a plan in place for preserving BDSP datasets. Through our collaboration with Amazon Web Services (AWS) Open Data Sponsorship Program, we have ensured that the public will continue to have access to any past BDSP datasets as long as it remains in business. We will do everything possible to sustain the existing browser for as long as financial/staffing commitments allow.

## BDSP Open Science Policy
The BDSP team has a firm commitment to open science. This includes, but is not limited to, making our data and code open-source, posting pre-prints, and prioritizing publishing in journals that support open access.

## Data Generation
A full description of the methods used to aggregate and prepare data within the BDSP will be provided shortly.
